## Simple React template with
- Multi-input calculator with floating point capability
- Simple TODO implemented via prompt
- Recipe viewer (stepper example)
- Tic-tac-toe with a smart AI opponent who tries to win or stop you from winning
- Two authorization options with validation. One using the Yup and react-hook-form libraries, the second one â€” without the libraries.
